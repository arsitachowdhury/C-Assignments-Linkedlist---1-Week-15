(2) Predict the output for linked list = 1->2->3->4->5:
  void traverse(Node* head) {
  while(head and head->next) {
  cout << head->data << ‘ ‘;
  head = head->next->next;
  }
 }
1. 1 2 3 4 5
2. 1 3 5
3. 2 4
4. 1 3

Answer-->

1. Initial list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
2. First iteration:
 head points to the first node (1).
 It prints 1.
 Moves head to head->next->next, which is the third node (3).
3. Second iteration:
 head now points to the third node (3).
 It prints 3.
 Moves head to head->next->next, which is the fifth node (5).
4. Third iteration:
 head now points to the fifth node (5).
 The condition head && head->next fails (since head->next is nullptr), so the loop terminates.
5. Final output:
 The function prints 1 3. Therefore, the correct answer is:
option (4)1 3
